# Predicting-the-number-of-likes-on-Instagram-using-regression-techniques
Developed regression-based machine learning models to predict the **number of likes on Instagram posts** using engagement, content, and posting-related features from the `Instagram_Data.csv` dataset.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **Instagram post popularity**, measured by the number of likes, using **regression techniques**. The analysis explores how various post attributes influence user engagement and applies statistical and machine learning models to generate accurate predictions.

The project includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model evaluation** to support insights into social media engagement patterns.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze factors that influence **Instagram post likes**
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on engagement metrics
- Build and evaluate **regression models** for prediction
- Compare model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics
- Provide insights applicable to **social media marketing strategies**

---

## 📁 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Instagram Engagement Dataset  
- **File Used:** `instagram_data.csv`  
- **Target Variable:** Number of Likes  
- **Type:** Social media engagement data  

*(Dataset contains post-level features such as engagement metrics, content attributes, and posting information.)*

---

## 🧾 Key Features in the Dataset
- Post engagement metrics (likes, comments, interactions)
- Content-related features
- Posting time and frequency attributes
- Account-level indicators (if available)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Regression modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Model development and evaluation
- **GitHub** – Version control and documentation

---

## 📈 Modeling Approach
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature scaling and selection
- Implementation of regression models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Regularization techniques (if applicable)
- Model evaluation using:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## ⚠️ Dataset Limitations
- Dataset may not reflect **current Instagram algorithm changes**
- Limited contextual information about post content
- Potential outliers in engagement metrics
- Engagement influenced by external factors not captured in the data

---
